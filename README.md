Following is the approach for this project:

1. Download the dataset
2. Unzip the data file into your R working directory
3. Read the training and test data
4. Read the data description and activity labels
5. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
6. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
7. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
8. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
9. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
